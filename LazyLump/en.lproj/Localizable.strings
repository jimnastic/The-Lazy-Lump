The “Surgical Billing: Get it to the Coder” app is meant to simplify how healthcare providers get information to their coders. Currently, most providers write down the procedures on an index card and carry it around in their pockets, for days and sometimes weeks before turning the information to the coder. These notes tend to be illegible and imprecise. If not turned in, the coder depends on dictation. Thus, no card, no dictation means no billing because no record. This is especially true for emergency cases and night time and weekend cases.

The app does not utilize cpt code since cpt codes are copyrighted. Please follow strict PHI policy when using this app and  use your secure hospital email system. You should  check with your institution prior to use. Remember, your patient is your priority and  protecting their identification  takes precedence over anything else. 

The camera  should not be used to photograph PHI. 

Please use the app responsibly.
